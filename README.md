# b64hs

Convert Hearthstone base64-encoded deckstrings into a Haskell datatype
representing a deck and display them.

Currently just an executable (without tests) but I am planning to
refactor some code into a library for Hearthstone as well as add tests.
This probably won't happen before late June or July though.
